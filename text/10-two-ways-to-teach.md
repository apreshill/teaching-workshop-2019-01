#### Presenter Notes: 

So what is a workshop? Or a lecture, or a course, or any other teaching event?

## Slide 3

#### Presenter Notes: 

When done right, teaching is not like a movie that you film once and then replay over and over again exactly the same way.

## Slide 4

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

When done well, teaching is more like a play: there is a script, but the script is incomplete until you perform it. To bring the script to life you need to make many performance decisions. To do that well requires knowing your craft: stage craft for a play, and teaching craft for us.

Learning teaching craft is an investment, and since you are in this room I suspect that you've already made deep career investments. How many people here are Data Scientists? Computer Scientists? Teachers by trade?

But you've already mastered one skillset, why master another one?


## Slide 5

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

And in fact, good teaching often seems like a form of improv: everyone has something to say, and knows how to say it, but everyone also has to be comfortable including the audience in what they’re doing.

Learning the craft of teaching takes time, and since you are in this room I suspect that you've already made some pretty significant investments in data science or programming. Since you've already mastered one skillset, why master another one?


## Slide 6

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

The answer is that as a species, we know as much about teaching and learning as we do about public health. The difference is, most of us don’t know the pedagogical equivalents of purifying drinking water, getting immunized, or eating well. You don’t have to learn very much to be a more effective teacher: you just have to learn things that are backed up by evidence, and that’s what we’re going to cover.


## Slide 7

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Here’s the schedule for the first day. We’re going to cover a lot of material, which means we’re going to skate over some things pretty quickly, but our experience giving workshops like this over the past several years makes us believe it will be worthwhile.


## Slide 8

### Title: Your Turn

#### Body 

Do you learn better when, you:

#### Presenter Notes: 

To get started, take out a sheet of paper and write A and B at the top. For the next few minutes, we will compare a series of statements. In each case, note whether you agree more with statement A or statement B. At the end we can tally up our answers and compare notes. 

## Slide 9

### Title: Survey

#### Body 

Do you learn better when, you:

#### Presenter Notes: 

Think back to when you learned R, did you learn better when you read about a function or tried to use it?

## Slide 10

### Title: Survey

#### Body 

Do you learn better when, you:

#### Presenter Notes: 

What about watching a video versus doing exercises?

## Slide 11

### Title: Survey

#### Body 

Do you learn better when, you:

#### Presenter Notes: 

Or attending a lecture versus discussion a problem with an expert?

## Slide 12

### Title: Survey

#### Body 

Do you learn better when, you:

#### Presenter Notes: 

Or having something explained to you versus explaining it to someone else (even, or particularly, if you don’t understand it well yourself)?

## Slide 13

### Title: Survey

#### Body 

Do you learn more from:

#### Presenter Notes: 

This one is a little different, but do you learn more from long sessions that cover a lot of ground, or short sessions interleaved with practice?

## Slide 14

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Alright, let's tally our votes. Did anyone have a higher score in the A column than in B? How can you describe the differences between these two columns?

If we ignore the last case for a moment, the techniques in Column A are all passive from the student's point of view: the teacher does something and the student watches. This is called “teacher-led learning”, and is typical of colleges class with assigned readings, lectures, and homework exercises that learners are supposed to do on their own without collaborating.

In contrast, the methods in the second column are all student-centered. This is called “active learning”, and fifty years of education research have shown over and over again that it’s more effective.

## Slide 15

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Here’s just one recent result from our field http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full.pdf

## Slide 16

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

So here’s our first big idea. For active learning to work, the learner must:

Receive the knowledge
Remember it
Reapply it
Reflect on it

And so must the teacher.

There must be feedback loops at several scales:
Inside the learner’s mind while learning
Between the learner and teacher in the class
Inside the teacher’s mind between classes

Adapted from Mayer, R. E. (2002). Multimedia learning. Psychology of learning and motivation, 41, 85-139. Chicago

Here’s the second big idea. As a teacher, you don’t have direct access to your learners’ memories. Here’s what you have instead:

Information goes through the sensory register to short-term memory.
Once information is in short term memory, we either rehearse it or forget it.
If we keep it in short term memory long enough, it is encoded for storage, and we can (hopefully) retrieve it later.

We’re going to revisit this diagram several times today. The important thing is this: when you’re teaching, you’re trying to put information into short-term memory and keep it there long enough for it to be transferred to long-term memory. If too much comes in too quickly, or if new material isn’t immediately used, it won’t be transferred and learning won’t take place.

## Slide 18

#### Presenter Notes: 

Bloom, B. S. (1956). Taxonomy of educational objectives. Vol. 1: Cognitive domain. New York: McKay, 20-24 (as revised by Anderso and Krathwohl, 2001)

Here’s our third big idea. Bloom's Taxonomy is a widely-used way to think about how well someone understands a subject. It was originally developed in the 1950s, and revised at the turn of the century, and while people can and will argue about exactly where a particular idea belongs, there’s broad agreement that these different levels really do represent different cognitive processes.

The taxonomy makes it clear that most levels of mastery involve doing, not just knowing. Its easy to see how activity, practice, and experience would contribute to these levels more than hearing a lecture.

## Slide 19

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

There is one other important level that is not recognized by Bloom's taxonomy.

Question: why do we still learn things in the age of Google?

Answer: because it is difficult to look up something if you don't know that it exists.

## Slide 20

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

In other words, simply being aware of the existence of a thing is a useful level of mastery and one that falls below remembering (since you do not need to actually remember the thing itself).

This is partly why lectures have survived as a teaching method. Most people don’t learn during the lecture: they learn outside when reading, reviewing, or doing exercises. What the lecture does is make them aware of what they ought to be studying.

When you’re creating a workshop, a lecture, or a course, you need to decide what level of understanding you’re aiming for. Yes, you would like everyone to be able to create new or original work, but time is limited, and they might want to spend it doing something else.

## Slide 21

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

The level you’re aiming for influences the style of teaching you use. Directed training has learners work through a pre-determined path of activities or exercises. It is good for learners who will need to do the featured tasks in a similar fashion after the training (apply).

Flipped class rooms are a special case of this. Student-professor interaction is focused on the activities, lectures and reading are reduced to out of class assignments.

Guided discovery involves setting up useful problems for students to solve and then providing feedback as the learner figures out how to solve the problems on their own, including what to learn to solve the problems. It mostly lives at the level of analyze and evaluate.

The Socratic method in law school is a closely monitored version of this, as are case studies in medicine or law. Both require learners to have a strong foundation in the area and an awareness of what there is to know.

Exploratory learning has the instructor provide a rich environment of resources (including themselves) and a prompt. Then the instructor gets out of the way. It requires sophisticated learners and yields unpredictable outcomes.

## Slide 22

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

And this brings us to Rule #2. (No, we haven’t seen Rule #1 yet - we’ll get to it.) Rule #2 states that you are not your learners. In particular, there’s a good chance that you’re more of an autodidact than most people, i.e., that you’re more comfortable teaching yourself by wandering around than the average human being. You have to be to some extent to get through grad school, but that means that if you (unconsciously) assume that the people you’re teaching won’t learn the same way you did, and won’t value the same things you did. Ignoring this is the root cause of a lot of ineffective teaching.

## Slide 23

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

On your own, decide what level of understanding each of these exercises is aiming for.
Compare your answers with your neighbor’s and come to a consensus.
Present your final decision and reasoning for one question that you disagreed on to the class.

Note: this technique is called think-pair-share.
