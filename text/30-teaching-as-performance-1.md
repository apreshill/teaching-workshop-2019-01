So how do people become experts? It’s not just ten thousand hours - as we said before, most people have spent that much time cooking or writing, but aren’t expert cooks or writers. Instead, it appears that part of the story is a three step process. In step 1, we get feedback on what we’re doing from someone more knowledgeable.

In step 2, we give feedback, and get feedback on that feedback. For example, we write an essay on character development in “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”, and get told where we are making sense and where we are not.

Step 3 is where the magic happens. Once we know how to critique, we can critique ourselves as we’re working. In musical terms, we’re listening to our own performance as we play. That feedback loop is so tight and so rewarding that our ability immediately takes off.

As Elizabeth Green documents in “Building a Better Teacher”, what high-performing school systems all over the world have in common is teachers watching teachers in the same way that athletes watch each other play and actors watch each other’s performance. Without this, things like standardized testing might tell teachers that they’re not doing well, but they don’t know what to change to get better. (We’ve all had that kind of feedback on a paper…)
