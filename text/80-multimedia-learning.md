The definitive summary of this research is the book MultiMedia Learning Theory, and I recommend it to you if you are interested. However, the important takeaways are easy to share here.

## Slide 3

### Title: Basics

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

One reason for this is that our brain uses a different cognitive pathway to process visual information than it does other types of information, such as verbal or symbolic information.

This has a direct effect on extrinsic load, the bad type of load. Suppose I am trying to explain something visual to you, like the shape of an object. If I tell you that the object looks like a circle on the bottom, but is flat on the top with five spiky parts, it will take more cognitive load to make sense of what I am saying than it would to just show you the object.

Why? Because here, you have to process the information with your weaker channel, and more than likely send the processed information to the visualization channel for interpretation.

Here you bypass all of that and send it straight to the visualization channel. In both cases the intrinsic load required to comprehend the actual shape is the same. We reduce the extrinsic load by showing the visual format.

#### Presenter Notes: 

Note: VAK is a myth - after repeated study, there is no evidence that matching instructional styles to people’s declared preference improves outcomes. (Meyer-Briggs is pseudoscience too, in case you were wondering…)

#### Presenter Notes: 

Sketch a small single-page cartoon that captures one core idea from the class you are next going to teach.
Compare it with your neighbor’s. What is one feature of yours that can be removed? What one feature should be added?
